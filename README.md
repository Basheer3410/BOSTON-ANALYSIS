# BOSTON-ANALYSIS
.  This problem involves the “Boston” data set, which we saw in the lab for this chapter. We will now try to predict per capita crime rate using the other variables in this data set. In other words, per capita crime rate is the response, and the other variables are the predictors.
a.	For each predictor, fit a simple linear regression model to predict the response. Describe your results. In which of the models is there a statistically significant association between the predictor and the response ? Create some plots to back up your assertions.
b.	Fit a multiple regression model to predict the response using all of the predictors. Describe your results. For which predictors can we reject the null hypothesis H0:βj=0 ?
#DESCRIPTION
This analysis uses the Boston dataset to predict per capita crime rate by examining individual predictors through simple linear regression and evaluating their statistical significance, followed by a multiple regression model using all predictors to identify variables that significantly influence crime rates.
