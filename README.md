# BOSTON-ANALYSIS
This project analyzes the Boston dataset to predict per capita crime rate using the remaining variables as predictors. It first applies simple linear regression for each predictor to identify statistically significant relationships with crime rate, supported by appropriate plots. It then fits a multiple regression model using all predictors to determine which variables significantly influence crime rates by testing the null hypothesis
