# BOSTON-ANALYSIS
This problem analyzes the Boston dataset to predict per capita crime rate using the remaining variables as predictors. It first applies simple linear regression for each predictor to identify statistically significant relationships with crime rate, supported by appropriate plots. It then fits a multiple regression model using all predictors to determine which variables significantly influence crime rates by testing the null hypothesis

#DESCRIPTION
This analysis uses the Boston dataset to predict per capita crime rate by applying simple and multiple linear regression to identify predictors that have a statistically significant impact on crime levels
